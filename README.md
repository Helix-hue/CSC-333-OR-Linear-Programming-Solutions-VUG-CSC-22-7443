A detailed description of the steps and methodology of running the puthon code
- Define the Decision Variables: These represent the quantities that we need to optimize (e.g., the number of units of product A and B, or hours of labor and material used).
- Set the Objective Function: The objective function represents the goal of the problem (e.g., maximize profit or minimize cost).
- Define the Constraints: Constraints are inequalities that define the limits or restrictions of the problem (e.g., resource availability, budget limits).
- Solve the Linear Program: Using the SciPy linprog function, the optimization problem is solved by finding the optimal values for the decision variables that maximize or minimize the objective function subject to the constraints.
- Visualize the Feasible Region: The feasible region, which represents the set of all possible solutions satisfying the constraints, is plotted using Matplotlib. The feasible region is shaded, and the optimal solution is marked on the graph.
- Output the Optimal Solution: The optimal values for the decision variables and the maximum or minimum value of the objective function are displayed as the solution.
